        <h1><span style="color: #ffffff">social media</span> guidelines</h1>

        <h5>Social mediums enable nonprofit organizations to create relationships and engage with their constituents. This allows them to nurture their online communities which, in fact creates, a viral marketing affect with little or no effort. And the costs associated with this marketing effort are often less expensive with better return-on-investment than traditional marketing efforts.<br>
        The realm of social media helps equip individuals with an outlet and tool to help in growing their own nonprofit organizations, as well as enabling individuals who have a specific interest in a charitable organization and who want to share it broadly.<br>
        Stakeholders take an interest in causes that relate to them and social mediums create an overall integrated experience with those very same stakeholders.</h5>

        <h4>One important insight in content creation for social mediums is that if you can involve the organizations beneficiaries in creating the content, the impact it will have in your networks will increase drastically. For Rotary this should be a desirable goal to expand on both at a national as well as on a regional level. Use the tools provided within the club, but also to try and give the tools to the people that Rotary interacts with.</h4>

        <h1></h1>

        <h2>Facebook</h2>

        <h5>Facebook is a great way to express the personality of your company. Facebook should be seen as a place to generate and engage an online following by sharing interesting content relevant to Rotary. Use Facebook to promote new projects, share upcoming events, and to start a conversation with eager young professionals in order to inspire them towards getting involved and eventually becoming members. Your Facebook page should offer a general overview of your social media presence by sharing the best content from all other social media channels.</h5>

        <h6>General guidelines for companies working with Facebook:<br></h6>
            <p>- Be authentic - Share what you're genuinely excited about and your customers will be excited too.<br>
            - Be responsive - When people comment on your posts, show that your business is listening and that you care. If you need more time to answer a question, let them know you’re looking into it.<br>
            - Be consistent - The more regularly you post, the more opportunity you have for connecting with people and building trust. Setting a schedule for your posts can also help maximize your team’s time.<br>
            - Do what works - Replicate your success on posts that get more engagement.<br>
            - Make successful posts into successful promotions - When you notice that a post is getting a lot of engagement, promote it to reach even more people. When people like, comment on or share your posts, their friends are also eligible to see those posts in News Feed.
            </p>

        <h6>Rotary Guidelines</h6>

        <p>Rotary Sweden should establish a facebook page where they can share engaging and relevant content. A suggestion is to think of time based themes, so that for example for two weeks Rotary Sweden talks about the Polio issue and the next two weeks about immigrant integration, the next two about start-up possibilities etc on their social platforms. These themes should also be used as inspiration for what the individual clubs could share and talk about.</p>

        <h4>The Individual Rotary Clubs should focus on having a structure with two touchpoints for Facebook. These should consist of:</h4>

        <p>One private Facebook Group for easy internal communication and sharing of information between club members. The communication within this group will only be accessible to club members and will be a good way to get information about meetings, events and projects etc. effectively out to all club members.<br><br>

        One Facebook Page for the club to use for communicating with the general public. The Page will be used for sharing content about both Rotary in general and about the specific club. The content should be focused on accomplishments and projects that Rotary and the club has done. Through engaging stories, ranging from how Rotary is helping people in big global projects, down to local projects about drug prevention or helping a start-up, it is much more likely that content is shared if there is an engaging story behind it. During the creation of this content there should be a focus on involving the people that Rotary interacts with and helps to get an outside perspective, which will give further depth to the content.</p>

        <h4>Good practice examples:<br><br>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rodakorset?fref=ts" target="_blank">Röda Korset Sverige - Facebook Page</a><br>
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rattviseformedlingen?fref=ts" target="_blank">Rättviseförmedlingen - Facebook Page</a><br>
          etc.
        </h4>

        <h1></h1>

        <h2>LinkedIn</h2>

        <p>LinkedIn has become somwhat of a static player in the djungle that is social media. The engagement is relatively low and many use it just as a place for your CV, in a somewhat more interactive suit. A good idea though is to let members link to their personal LinkedIn profile in the new Member Search service, so that the information they already have on LinkedIn can complement the information on their personal page in Rotary Swedens Web Service.</p>

        <h1></h1>

        <h2>Twitter</h2>

        <h5>Twitter is much more effective at helping you get involved in one-on-one conversations than Facebook and captures more of the power of face-to-face, in-person interaction.  It’s useful for connecting on a more personal level with people in your communities as well as your fans. It’s a one-on-one conversation and so people feel more emotionally involved when you talk to them on Twitter.  Another unique feature to Twitter is the ability to use hashtags. Hashtags are frequently overused, but extremely useful in the right ways like at events.  If you’re involved in events, follow and use the relevant hashtag to participate in the conversation.  This is a great way to get noticed and connect with other people at the event.</h5>

        <p>If the club chooses to have a Twitter account it should focus on talking about relevant issues and topics for Rotary and its members. Two way-communication is key to having a successful Twitter presence. However, something to think about before starting up a twitter account is that Twitter is a time consuming platform. For it to be a relevant channel it is required to continuously spark and hold conversations through tweets and retweets.</p>

        <h6>What To Tweet</h6>

        <p>News and Events – Since an increasingly large number of people are using Twitter as their main source of news, it’s a great way to let people know about upcoming events or things going on with in Rotary. If people are following you on Twitter then the odds are pretty good they want to know what you’re up to.<br><br>

        Personal Commentary – More than pages on Facebook, Twitter is a great place to let people know what you’re thinking. Whether it’s about the local events happening in your community or your weekly meetings, people want to see some human stories in your marketing.<br><br>

        Questions – If you’re trying to figure out what kind of projects would be really important to the members of your local community, why not ask them? It’s a fast and cheap form of market research, and also a great way to get people involved.<br><br>

        Promotions – If you have events or open meetings, consistently letting people know about them can help build momentum.<br><br>

        Photos and Videos – Just like with Facebook, people love to see what you’re up to.  Photos and Videos of your work in the community and abroad, events and other goings-on are great for sharing on Twitter.</p>

        <h4>Good practice examples:<br><br>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/mcdse" target="_blank">McDonalds</a><br>
          etc.
        </h4>

        <h1></h1>

        <h2>Instagram</h2>

        <h5>Instagram is an effective channel for promoting your projects and work in the community. Rotarians and volunteers should be encouraged to use Instagram and hashtag their inspiring interactions with Rotary and the community.  Instagram also lets you make super short videos and tell a quick, “bite-sized” story about what’s going on.  It is essential that volunteers, Rotarians, and anyone else involved in projects and happenings should be encouraged to Instagram and hashtag their experiences through Facebook, Twitter, your website, and signage to create content to display through your social dashboard to take advantage of the free marketing created by your followers.  Attractive posts can be shared on Facebook.</h5>
