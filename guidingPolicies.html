      <h1><span style="color: #ffffff">Guiding</span> Policies</h1>

      <h3>3 missions</h3>

      <p>The 3 focal points for this digital strategy are:<br><br>

        - Get people to talk about Rotary.<br>
        - Show what Rotary does.<br>
        - Invite people to Rotary.

      <h2>External</h2>

      <h4>Openness & Transparency</h4>

      <p>For people to become aware and interested in the Rotary brand and experience, the use of these tools and guidelines will be necessary:<br><br>

      - A coherent social media strategy, with a purpose. Rotary and the members will use tools and channels to communicate in a meaningful way what Rotary is and what it means to be a Rotary member.<br><br>

      - Storytelling/Storydoing. Rotary members will use tools and platforms to show the world in a clear way what they do and accomplish. But also give tools to the people in contact with Rotary to help build the stories.<br><br>

      - Opening up for connections with people outside of rotary, through networking, projects and mentorships etc.<br><br>

      - A clear digital communication that shows the value of Rotary as a place for personal development and doing something to make the world better.</p>

      <h4>Sharing the power of Rotary to people with initiative</h4>

      <p>To get a person with initiative interested and invested in Rotary there has to be something in it for that person from the beginning. Through platforms where Rotary can collaborate with “outside” people on projects, interesting connections can be made.<br><br>

      Rotary will connect with ambitious people by giving them the opportunity to join in or help on existing Rotary projects, or even pitch their own ideas which they think could serve the society. Rotary will share their experience and knowledge to help the projects they think are relevant, and in return gaining help and investment from the target group in Rotary before they start thinking about becoming a member.

      <h4>Lower the barrier of entrance</h4>

      <p>To lower the barrier into Rotary and the “I might not be good enough”, Rotary will communicate with an open attitude in their digital presence.<br><br>

      Rotary will invite people to connect without being members, start conversations around topics that are relevant for both Rotary and the target group, both online and Offline.<br><br>

      Rotary should make it possible to easily get a taste of the rotary experience without the commitment of having to become a member.</p>

      <h2>Internal</h2>

      <h4>Rotary as a more valuable network</h4>

      <p>The knowledge and experience within the Rotary network is valuable both for the target group and existing members.<br><br>

      By making it easier for clubs to interact with other clubs, aswell as extend their network outside of rotary, new connections and stories will emerge, strengthening and exposing the values of Rotary.</p>

      <h4>Flexible membership. Bring value to changing need of a member</h4>

      <p>By the use of digital tools and agile thinking Rotary will make it easier to be a member.

      These digital opportunities can help a club communicate more effectively, letting the information find users instead of the other way around, and maybe even spark new, modern forms of which a club can operate.</p>

      <h4>Find new connections through mentorship program</h4>

      <p>To make the mentorship program valuable, Rotary will find relevant platforms and partners to reach out with the program to.<br><br>

      Finding an effective way of matching the right mentor with the right mentee will be an important feature of this platform. Also encouraging this process to be more natural and organic, for these connections to happen by themselves, through easy tools or systems.</p>
