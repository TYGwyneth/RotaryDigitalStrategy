        <h2>Member Search</h2>

        <h5>With the new platform for search within the organization that is in development, Rotary has a great resource for Opening up and reaching out to people who are interested in the organization. The part that should be most interesting to leverage, working towards getting people interested in Rotary should be the Member Search feature. This feature could be expanded in two ways to achieve this goal:</h5>

        <h3>Open Member Search</h3>

        <p>A general solution for opening up search for anyone interested in the people within Rotary and what skills and competences that exists within the organization. The member search feature could be implemented into its own open platform, a website for example. A convenient way for anyone interested in specific persons or skills within Rotary to quickly see where and who is part of Rotary, and how to get in contact fore more information.</p>

        <h3>API/Embeddable Member Search</h3>

        <p>A version of member search for other corporations, organizations or public authorities etc. to implement or embed Rotary’s member search into their own platforms. This could be done either by making an embeddable plugin for others to put on their respective platforms, or probably easier opening up and promoting the API for the search to have other implement the feature themselves. Both ways have pros and cons that should be further evaluated.</p>

        <h1></h1>

        <p>The member search should be promoted towards Universities, The Unemployment Office (Arbetsförmedlingen), Immigration Authorities etc. This could be promoted through mentorship possibilities through the new mentorship program,  as a selling point towards these potential partners.<br><br>
  
        Another option could be to develop an implementation for Linkedin. This would have to be investigated further.</p>
