        <h3>Background</h3>

        <h5>The idea behind Rotary in the past was to gather people from every profession into a club to, in that way represent the society as a whole, to make change that matters.<br><br>

        Today, this old notion of getting someone from every profession is somewhat of an impossible feat, due to the immense diversity in professions and the rapid change in society and the industries. The way in which Rotary is suppose to work, to represent the society as a whole has become in that way harder, but due to technology it has in another way become easier.<br><br>

        It’s easier than ever to get access to peoples opinions and problems through the rise of the internet and social media.  Instead of looking internally to Rotarians for insights into defining the best ways to improve society based on their individual opinions and areas of professional expertise, Rotary has the opportunity to serve society in a new way by inviting people to share their opinions and talk about their problems, and how Rotary can best meet these needs.</h5>

        <h6>Why</h6>

        <p>Gain new younger members to Rotary.</p>

        <h6>How</h6>

        <p>Rotary should take actions that are relevant to the target group, by listening and letting people be part of projects, and then show what they are doing, by letting the people involved tell the personal stories surrounding these projects.<br><br>

        By doing this Rotary could bring their heritage into the present and be something that is related to being professional that makes a difference in the world, while at the same time being open and transparent about what they are doing and inviting people to develop together, and making the world a better place.</p>

        <h6>What</h6>

        <h3>#RotaryNow</h3>

        <h4>#RotaryNow is a tool and platform in one.</h4>

        <p>As a tool it is a hashtag that will be used in social media to tell the stories of Rotary. These stories could be anything from a volunteer trip to india, to an interesting meeting with someone inspirational.<br><br>

        But it’s important to also let the people that Rotary help and work with tell their stories, about their contact with Rotary. #RotaryNow is therefore both a tool for Rotarians to tell about their experience from inside of Rotary, but also a tool that should be promoted to be used when Rotary work with external people and organizations, to get that outside perspective of Rotary as well. This is to spark interest in what Rotary is about by being more transparent, by telling stories.<br><br>

        The stories shared with #RotaryNow , by the use of a universal hashtag, will have a common denominator in social media, giving them the chance to make a bigger impact, become trending and be easily searchable. The use of a hashtag will also serve as a big help in the other, platform part of the concept.</p>

        <h4>As a platform #RotaryNow is a website consisting of two parts; The Present and The Future.</h4>

        <p>The Present part is a web page that collects the latest stories people have shared with #RotaryNow in one place. Fetching these posts automatically from social media platforms through their APIs.<br><br>

        This page will include a map where peoples posts will be placed to get an overview of what projects are going on in Rotary and what people are saying about them. It will also include the latest pictures and feeds from Instagram and Twitter. It could also include toplists of the most talked about projects and places from Rotary members and people they interact with.<br><br>

        The first purpose of this page is to show what Rotary actually does, being more transparent and open through sharing the accomplishments of members and other people involved. The second purpose is to be an inspiration and gateway into the second part of the platform, The Future: (suggest/challenge project thingy).<br><br>

        The Future part is a page that consists of two sections.<br><br>

        The first part is a “big challenge” brief for a predetermined world problem that Rotary sweden has chosen, that needs a creative solution. This will be somewhat of a competition for people to submit their best solution to a specific problem, and in return get the chance to win and be part of the actual project that will emerge and bring to life the solution that they themselves believe in, with the help of Rotary. This will create an incentive for people to become engaged and interact with Rotary without having to become actual members, while at the same time contributing to the values of Rotary.<br><br>

        The second part is a way for rotary to try and listen in a better way what the community around them actually needs, at the same time as connecting with people with ambitions and initiative. This will be a feature where people can suggest problems and solutions to their local Rotary clubs, that they think Rotary could help with. This would be smaller projects where Rotary could collaborate with the local community to make change, and at the same time extend the Rotary network outside the clubs, raising awareness of the Brand and meeting new potential members.</p>
