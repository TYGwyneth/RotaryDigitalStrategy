      <h1><span style="color: #ffffff">corporate</span> narrative</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <h5>A knowledge within corporate narrative has become essential in the branding of modern businesses. It’s a way for organisations and corporations to define their deeper purpose in order to ensure a clear communication and a credible brand awareness. When apple made its way into the market of computer electronics it was not without distinguishing one of its largest competitors IBM. A clear communication and identity was important to find the right customers and gain a stronger position on the market. IBM at that time marketed with the slogan “Think” branded themselves as the expert. Apple and Steve Jobs responded to this with the slogan - “Think different”, and by this branded themselves as the innovator on the market. 
      Another example is Virgin and Richard Branson who started out as Virgin Records 1972 and since then hasn't been afraid to constantly try out new territories. Going from selling records to offering orbital human space flights for regular people. Many economists has been perplexed (?) by its recklessness, asking themselves how one company can act in so many different markets. Still, Virgins communication and brand awareness is crystal clear, they’re marketed as the explorer - and with Richard Branson as their main ambassador Surfing waves and jumping parachutes while being surrounded by young beautiful women - this is being communicated in all their online presence.</h5>

      <p>We’ve used a character analysis model to define Rotary based on different character archetypes. By using this model we divided Rotary into two characters where the first one is based on our subconscious perception of the organisation, and the second one based on what we think Rotary should communicate to be more interesting and to reach our common objective - to gain new younger members.
      <br>

      After this we compared these characteristics to different archetypes to see where Rotary would fit in. The twelve most commonly used archetypes are the innocent, the orphan, the hero, the caregiver, the explorer, the rebel, the lover, the creator, the jester, the sage, the magician and the ruler. We ended up distinguishing two main archetypes in Rotarys brand, namely the sage and the hero - where the sage represents what Rotary is today, and the Hero represents what Rotary should become.<br><br>

      "Förklara Skillnaden mellan sage och hero och hur det passar med alfred och batman."<br>

      We’ve used the analogy of Alfred and Batman to describe these archetypes, where Alfred is the sage and Batman the hero. Some of the key-words that should inspire this new direction should be:<br><br>

      Listening<br>
      Action<br>
      Motion<br>
      Now<br>
      Ambitious</p>
